Recent Java and C++ Projects completed over the last year. 
The C++ projects include implementations of various data structures. 
The Java Projects include basic object oriented programming projects, 
as well as an implementation of a slot machine (with JUnit testing) and a GUI project simulating the "Maxwell's Demon" experiment
